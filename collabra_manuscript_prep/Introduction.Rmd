  Moral dumbfounding occurs when people defend a moral judgment even though they cannot provide a reason in support of this judgment. It manifests as an admission of not having reasons, or the use of unsupported declarations (\enquote{it’s just wrong}) or tautological reasons (\enquote{because it’s incest}) as justifications for a judgment. We test a dual-processes explanation of moral dumbfounding, where moral dumbfounding is an example of conflict between a habitual response (making a judgment) and a response that results from deliberation (providing a reason for the judgment).  The dumbfounding paradigm involves three possible responses: (a) providing reasons for a judgment (deliberative/controlled process); (b) accepting the counter-arguments and rating the behaviour as \enquote{not wrong} (habitual/automatic process); (c) a dumbfounded response (habitual/automatic process).  Cognitive load manipulations have been shown to inhibit deliberative responding.  We present 6 studies in which dumbfounded responding was investigated under cognitive load manipulations. We hypothesized that rates of providing reasons would be reduced under cognitive load. The identification of reasons was inhibited in Studies 1, 2, 3, and 6, but not in Studies 4 or 5. The results provide some evidence for a dual-process explanation of moral dumbfounding.  We found some evidence that dumbfounded responding may be linked with Need for Cognition.

Moral dumbfounding occurs when people defend a moral judgment even though they cannot provide a reason in support of this judgment [Haidt et al., -@haidt_moral_2000; @haidt_emotional_2001; see also McHugh, et al., -@mchugh_searching_2017a; -@mchugh_reasons_2020]. It has traditionally been seen as evidence for intuitionist and dual-process theories of moral judgment [e.g., @crockett_models_2013; @cushman_multisystem_2010; @cushman_action_2013; @greene_secret_2008; @haidt_emotional_2001; @prinz_passionate_2005; though this narrative has been contested, e.g., @guglielmo_unfounded_2018; Royzman et al., -@royzman_curious_2015]. Despite the influence of moral dumbfounding on the morality literature, the phenomenon is not well understood. Here we present a pre-registered test of one prediction of a dual-process explanation of moral dumbfounding.

# Moral Dumbfounding: A Dual-Process Perspective
Drawing on dual-process theories of reasoning and moral judgment [e.g., @greene_secret_2008; @cushman_action_2013; @brand_dualprocess_2016; @bago_intuitive_2019], we propose that moral dumbfounding occurs as a result of a conflict in dual-processes [@bonner_conflict_2010; @deneys_bias_2012; @deneys_conflict_2008; @evans_resolution_2007; see also @deneys_logic_2019]. In classic dual-process reasoning accounts, conflicts occur when a habitual/intuitive response is different from a response that results from deliberation [@bonner_conflict_2010]. Examples of such conflicts include base rate neglect problems [@bonner_conflict_2010; @deneys_bias_2012; @deneys_conflict_2008; @evans_resolution_2007], the conjunction fallacy [@deneys_bias_2012; @tversky_extensional_1983], and perhaps most relevant to the current discussion, a seemingly irrational but persistent unwillingness to contact various symbolically “contaminated” objects, despite assurances these items are sanitary [e.g., items believed to have had prior contact with: an AIDS victim, someone who had been in a car accident, or a murderer, see @rozin_sensitivity_1994 @lerner_when_1999]. We note that the original, unpublished dumbfounding manuscript included tasks closely resembling this final example [Haidt et al., -@haidt_moral_2000]. 

In line with the above, we propose that dumbfounding occurs when a habitual (moral judgment) response is in conflict with a deliberative response. In studies of moral dumbfounding, following an initial judgment, there are typically three responses available to participants: (1) providing a reason or justification for a judgment (henceforth reason-giving); (2) accepting  counter-arguments and rating particular behaviors as “not wrong” (nothing-wrong); (3) maintaining a judgment without justification or reasons (dumbfounding). Both reason-giving and nothing-wrong can be accounted for by existing approaches to moral judgment [e.g., @cushman_action_2013], and while reason-giving is the most common response, dumbfounding is reliably observed [see @mchugh_searching_2017a; @mchugh_reasons_2020] and remains an anomaly.

Drawing on existing theorizing [@cushman_action_2013; @haidt_emotional_2001; McHugh et al., -@mchugh_moral_2022], we assume that making a moral judgment is an intuitive/habitual response involving relatively little deliberation, while reason-giving requires greater deliberation (a deliberative response). In this view, conflict occurs when deliberation fails to identify reasons for a judgment, and its resolution depends on the availability of cognitive resources for deliberation – further deliberation may identify relevant reasons. Alternatively, participants may resolve the conflict by accepting the arguments presented and changing their judgment (nothing-wrong). We propose that dumbfounding is observed when this conflict cannot be resolved. We hypothesize that nothing-wrong involves more deliberation than dumbfounding but less deliberation than reason-giving. The hypothesized relative amounts of deliberation for each response are outlined in Figure 1. We note that this explanation is not unique to dual-process approaches, but is also consistent with a unimodal [@kruglanski_intuitive_2011] or categorization [@mchugh_moral_2022] approaches, both of which predict that lower processing capacity reduces reason-giving, and increases dumbfounding.

This account of moral dumbfounding affords a clear testable hypothesis: under manipulations that affect the availability of resources for deliberation, responses in the moral dumbfounding paradigm should evidence variation in frequency of deliberative versus habitual responses. Cognitive load manipulations – such as completing an attention/memory task simultaneously with a primary task – have been shown to inhibit deliberative responding [@deneys_conflict_2008; @evans_rapid_2005; @evans_dualprocess_2013; @schmidt_effects_2016]. We have identified reason-giving as involving more deliberation than alternative responses in the dumbfounding paradigm. Thus, we predict that a cognitive load manipulation should inhibit reason-giving in a moral dumbfounding task, leading to an increase in habitual responding, such as dumbfounding or nothing-wrong.
