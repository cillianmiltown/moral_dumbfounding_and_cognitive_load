# What is Moral Dumbfounding

## Heinz
In Europe, a woman was near death from a very bad disease, a special kind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium for which a druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to make. The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying, and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said, "No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it." So, Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's store to steal the drug for his wife. The druggist had Heinz arrested and charged.

## Trolley
A Trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. It will kill them all on impact. Paul is on a bridge under which it will pass. He can stop it by putting something very heavy in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to him – Paul's only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. Paul decides to push the man.

## Jennifer
Jennifer works in a medical school pathology lab as a research assistant. The lab prepares human cadavers that are used to teach medical students about anatomy. The cadavers come from people who had donated their body for the general use of the researchers in the lab. The bodies are normally cremated, however, severed cuts may be disposed of at the discretion of lab researchers, One night Jennifer is leaving the lab when she sees a body that is going to be discarded the next day. Jennifer was a vegetarian, for moral reasons. She thought it was wrong to kill animals for food. But then, when she saw a body about to be cremated, she thought it was irrational to waste perfectly edible meat. So she cut off a piece of flesh, and took it home and cooked it. The person had died recently of a heart attack, and she cooked the meat thoroughly, so there was no risk of disease

## Julie & Mark
Julie and Mark, who are brother and sister, are travelling together in France. They are both on summer vacation from college. One night they are staying alone in a cabin near the beach. They decide that it would be interesting and fun if they tried making love. At very least it would be a new experience for each of them. Julie was already taking birth control pills, but Mark uses a condom too, just to be safe. They both enjoy it, but they decide not to do it again. They keep that night as a special secret between them, which makes them feel even closer to each other.

## Cognitive Load and Moral Dumbfounding


> <div id="footer"> <font size=2>Cillian McHugh - 19/11/21</font size></div>

- Manipulations of `r colFmt("Cognitive load", cogload)` are known to inhibit `r colFmt("deliberative responding",rational)`

- Recall the three response options in `r colFmt("dumbfounding",conflict)`
  - `r colFmt("(a) It's wrong and I can provide a valid reason",rational)` 
  - `r colFmt("(b) It's wrong but I can't think of a reason",sentiment)`
  - `r colFmt("(c) There is nothing wrong (competing intuitions)",sentiment)`

## Individual Differences in Moral Dumbfounding


> <div id="footer"> <font size=2>Cillian McHugh - 19/11/21</font size></div>

- Dumbfounded responding may be linked with individual differences

- `r colFmt("Need for Cognition",rational1)` has been linked to dual-process approaches to cognition

- The `r colFmt("Need for Cognition Scale",rational1)` (`r colFmt("NFC",rational1)`) is a measure of an individual’s tendency <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*"to engage in and enjoy effortful analytic activity"* <br>

<p style="font-size:16px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[@forsterlee_examination_1999, p. 471; see also @cacioppo_need_1982]</p> 
  - tendency to engage in `r colFmt("deliberation",rational)`
  - a person’s need to understand and make sense of the world

<p style="font-size:16px">[@cacioppo_need_1982; @petty_efficient_1984; @petty_dispositional_1996; @forsterlee_examination_1999; @evans_dualprocess_2013]</p>


## Individual Differences in Moral Dumbfounding


> <div id="footer"> <font size=2>Cillian McHugh - 19/11/21</font size></div>

### We hypothesised:
- People who score highly on the `r colFmt("NFC",rational1)`
  - will be more likely to `r colFmt("provide reasons",rational)` for their judgement
- People who score low on the `r colFmt("NFC",rational1)`
  - are likely `r colFmt("to fail to identify reasons",sentiment)` for their judgement
- `r colFmt("NFC",rational1)` is related to a need to understand and make sense of the world
  - Of the people who `r colFmt("fail to identify reasons",sentiment)` for their judgement: 
    - those who `r colFmt("revise",sentiment)` their judgement will likely score higher on the `r colFmt("NFC",rational1)` than people who provide a `r colFmt("dumbfounded response",sentiment)`

  - &chi;^2^(`r meta3$df`) = `r round(meta3$chisq, digits=3)`, *p* `r paste(p_report(meta3$p))` (Fisher’s method)
  - when weighting for sample size, *z* `r paste(p_report(meta4$z))`, *p* `r paste(p_report(meta4$p))` (Stouffer's Z-score method)
